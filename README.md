## 📚 Developer Blog Preview

> **Q1:** What are the different ways to select an element in the DOM?  
Use `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`, and more...

> **Q2:** Difference between `innerHTML`, `innerText`, and `textContent`?  
- `innerHTML`: gets/sets HTML inside  
- `innerText`: visible text only  
- `textContent`: includes hidden content too

> **Q3:** What is event delegation in the DOM?  
Attach a listener to a parent and handle events from children — efficient & scalable.

> **Q4:** What is event bubbling in the DOM?  
Events flow from child to parent. Use `stopPropagation()` to control.
